# Dish Recommendation System

## Overview

The Dish Recommendation System allows restaurant owners to set up intelligent recommendations for menu items. When customers add items to their cart, they'll see personalized suggestions for complementary dishes, helping increase average order value and improve customer experience.

## Features

### 1. Item-Level Recommendations
- When a customer adds an item to their cart, they see recommendations for other items that pair well with it
- Recommendations appear immediately after adding an item
- Visual design with attractive cards showing item details and pricing

### 2. Checkout Recommendations
- In the cart, customers see additional recommendations based on their entire order
- Helps complete the meal with complementary items
- Prevents duplicate recommendations (won't suggest items already in cart)

### 3. Admin Configuration
- Restaurant owners can set recommendations for each menu item through the menu builder
- Easy-to-use interface with checkboxes for selecting recommended items
- Real-time preview of recommendations
